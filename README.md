# Bare-Bones Ubuntu Set-up
This branch is basically the same as `master`, but without the aesthetic changes such as desktop themes & extensions, .vimrc, bash customizations, and the installation of zsh.

It has been tested on fresh installations of:  
`Ubuntu 20.04 LTS`  
`Ubuntu 18.04 LTS`

The majority of the code and structure were taken and adapted from:  
https://github.com/victoriadrake/dotfiles/  
https://github.com/tomnomnom/dotfiles

## How to run set-up
Install git  
```sh
sudo apt install git
```

```

```sh

```
