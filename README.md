# Ubuntu Set-up
This project allows me to automatically install my preferred packages, programs, dotfiles, and desktop customizations on Ubuntu. 

It has been tested on fresh installations of:  
`Ubuntu 20.04 LTS - GNOME desktop`  
`Ubuntu 18.04 LTS - GNOME desktop`

The majority of the code and structure were taken and adapted from:  
https://github.com/victoriadrake/dotfiles/  
https://github.com/tomnomnom/dotfiles

## How to run set-up
Install git  
```sh
sudo apt install git
```

```sh
git clone https://github.com/KurtKline/ubuntu-setup.git
```

```

```

Sit back and relax â˜•
